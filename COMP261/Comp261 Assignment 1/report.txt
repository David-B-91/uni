DAVID BURRELL - COMP 261 ASSIGNMENT ONE - AUCKLAND MAP.

Code does:
 		Loads all files except polygons into relevant data structures.
		Displays Map as nodes and edges on the UI.
		Allows navigation using the UI arrows and Zoom in and Zoom out buttons.
		Uses the search bar to somewhat highlight roads and display information.
		uses onClick to find closest node
		Attempted to comment methods.

Does not:
		Completely highlight all road segments (not sure why, manages to select parts of queen st but not the whole)
		highlight the nodes, using the same method changed for nodes to hightlight that i do for segments,
			but just doesn't highlight them.
		The Search function also doesn't display the correct road info sometimes, thisll be due to using contains
			instead of equals.
		anything beyond the core of the assignement I didn't get to.

Data Structures:
		nodeMap - a Map of Node objects using node IDs as keys, and nodes for values.
		roadMap - a map of Road objects using road IDs as keys, and roads for values.
		segmentList - list of all segments in the segment file.
		chosenSegment - Map of segments using roadIDs as kets and segments as values.
				for use in selecting roads using search funtion.
		chosenNode - Map of Nodes using node IDs as keys and nodes for values, for use
				in onClick to select and highlight nearest node for mouse click.
Testing: 	
		to test i just ran the program and used a series of prints to see if the program was 
			getting to the parts of the code i needed to. some of these prints may still be 
			in the code.
