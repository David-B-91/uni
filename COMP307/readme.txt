To Run part1: run the executable jar from cmd line using arguments "iris-training.txt iris-test.txt" 
	WINDOWS cmd line example: java -jar part1 iris-training.txt iris-test.txt
	I beleve it should take any training and test sets of files in the same format as the iris datasets.
To run part2: run the executable jar from cmd line using arguments "hepatitis-training.dat hepatitis-test.dat"
	WINDOWS cmd lien example: java -jar part2 hepatitis-training.dat hepatitis-test.dat
	it should also take any combination of the provided .dat files.
To run part3: run the executable jar from cmd line using arguments "image.data"
	WINDOWS cmd lien example: java -jar part3 image.data
	unfortunately i have run out of time to tidy up the system outputs of the perceptron. hopefully you'll be able to look at the source code for a better understanding
