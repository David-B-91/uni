This is a doctest based regression suite for assignment1.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

Import the functions
>>> from assignment1 import count_after

Test the list problem:
>>> count_after(["a","b","c"],"b")
1
>>> count_after(["a","b","c"],"c")
0
>>> count_after(["a","b","c"],"")
3
>>> count_after([],"")
0
>>> count_after([],"a")
0
>>> count_after([],[])
Expected a string
>>> count_after([],"a")
0
>>> count_after("","a")
Expected a list of words
