This is a doctest based regression suite for assignment1.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

Import the functions
>>> from assignment1 import speed

Test the distance calculation
>>> for i in range(1, 10):
...     speed(52.6,i)
