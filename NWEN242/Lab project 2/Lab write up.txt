4.1 a) 	basic: 10
		bubble: 10
		forward: 10
		
4.1 b)	basic: 9
		bubble: 11
		forward: 9
		
4.1 c)	the second add instruction needs the value
		of $2 before it has been written back into
		the	register by the first ADD instruction.
		this is a Data Hazard.
		
4.2 a)	basic: 5, jump made at 6.
		bubble: 5, jump made at 6.
		forward: 4, jump made at 4.
		
4.2 b)	for the basic mode, the addi is executed
		and results in the branch instruction not
		being taken on the following loop.
		for the other 2 modes, the addi doesn't
		enter the pipeline.
		
4.2 c)	this is a Control Hazard, we don't know
		which instruction to fetch before the
		branch is taken or not.
		
4.3 a)	basic: 10
		bubble: 12
		forward: 10
		
4.3 b)	basic: 8
		bubble: 10
		forward: 8
		
4.3	c)	Data Hazard, ADDI instuction needs the
		result of the LW instruction before it is
		done.

5.2 a)	the program instuctions are only executed
		during clock cycles, so the less cycles
		used, the faster the program will be
		executed. instuctions are depentent on
		cycles.
		
5.2	b)	because the different datapaths all have 
		different optimisations to speed up the 
		execution of the program through the
		pipeline. each optimisation condenses the
		instructions on the pipeline, to allow
		more instructions to be executed
		simultaniously.
